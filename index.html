									<h2><a href="https://github.com/Ohlight10/MY-SQL-PROJECTS/blob/main/HOUSING.sql">DATA CLEANING IN SQL<br />
									</a></h2>
									<p>In this Nashville housing project, I cleaned up messy data in a SQL server. The data was all tangled and full of mistakes and old stuff. I did this because it's important to have good data for making smart decisions. First, I got a big CSV file with lots of numbers, addresses, and property info. I put it into a MySQL database and made tables to sort it out. I fixed address problems, like abbreviations and mistakes. I used SQL to make them all the same. Then, I dealt with missing info by joining data and filling in the gaps. I also found duplicate records and used SQL to remove them. After lots of work, the messy data became neat and useful. The lesson here is that even messy data can become valuable with the right tools and skills.</p>

									<p>In the heart of a global crisis, where COVID-19 had affected millions of lives worldwide, i used MySQL to analyze pandemic data from the World Health Organization. I aimed to help countries and continents understand the virus's impact and make smart choices. I calculated the percentage of a country's population with COVID-19 using SQL. Then, I found countries with high infection rates using SQL's tools. I also looked at deaths per continent and compared it to the population to find the hardest-hit areas. This project showed how data and MySQL could make a difference in a crisis, leading to a healthier world.</p>

									<p>In Seattle, a place with beautiful mountains and water,I wanted to learn about the Airbnb market because of my desire to travel to the place for vacation. I got a big dataset with info about Airbnb places in the city, but it wasn't perfect. It had missing stuff and problems, so I fixed it by removing duplicates and filling in missing info. Then, I looked at the data to compare prices for bedrooms in different areas of Seattle. I used Tableau to make a cool dashboard with a map. On the map, each area had a color to show the price. People could click on an area to see more about it, like the price and how many places were there.</p>

									<p></p>In the busy city of Metropolis, people were using bikes more for transportation. Local bike shops were selling lots of bikes, and they wanted to understand their customers better. I downloaded the messy CSV file with customer info and clean it. I used Excel to remove duplicates, fix dates, and add missing info. The data became neat and useful. Then, I made it look better by organizing it, adding titles, and using colors. I made a pivot table to study the bike buyers' details. I sorted them by age, marital status, education, gender, income, and region. I noticed that most bike buyers were young, meaning young people liked using bikes. To share my findings, I created a dashboard with charts and graphs in Excel. This project showed that using data analysis and Excel can give helpful insights and make the city more bike-friendly.</p>

									<p>AlexTheAnalyst, a data expert, conducted a big survey to learn more about the data field and career trends. They asked data professionals worldwide about their favorite programming languages, job titles, salaries, and how hard it was to start in the data world. I downloaded the csv file and use Power BI to make a cool dashboard with the survey results. It showed that data jobs are everywhere, and Python was the top choice for programming. The dashboard also displayed salaries for different roles, and data scientists and data engineers made the most money. Most people in the survey thought it was somewhat hard to get into data, so education and experience are important for newcomers.</p>
